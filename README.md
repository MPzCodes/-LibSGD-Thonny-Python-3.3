# -LibSGD-Thonny-Python-3.13
libSGD to use with Thonny or Phyton 3.13

Welcome to LibSGD for Phyton

LibSGD is a simple game development library that provides a high level, easy to use 'scene graph' style API for writing games and apps.

LibSGD also support loading and playing audio and will eventually include network functionality.

The library is coded in C++, but the primary public API is pure 'C', making it highly compatible with a wide range of platforms and languages.

Currently supported languages include C/C++, Blitz3D, BlitzMax, Python and node.js. Support for more languages is on the way. Here comes the files for Thonny with pyhton 3.10 and Phyton 3.13

LibSGD is licensed under the Zlib/PNG license.

How to use Thonny with the libsgd-0.18.1 version:

Thonny works with python 3.10 and needs the cp310 version.

Automatic install (don work on my pc, i donÂ´t why):
1) You start Thonny
   go in menu of Thonny to -> Tools -> Manage plugins... -> "Install from local file"
   and choose the "libsgd-0.18.1-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl" file


Manually install (works fine)

2) You search for the Thonny folder and exe file:
for example:
c:\Users\<pc-username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Thonny\thonny.exe
here you search the  "site-package" folder
c:\Users\<pc-username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Thonny\Lib\site-packages\

In these folder you copy the 
"libsgd" and "libsgd-0.18.1.dist-info" manually.

for example:

jedi-0.19.1.dist-info
libsgd
libsgd-0.18.1.dist-info
mccabe-0.7.0.dist-info

3) The demo folder can be copied wherever you want. e.g. to the documents folder.
Here it is only important to have the assets folder in the same folder as the demos of the PySource folder. The assets folder contains the media datas.

How to use python 3.13 with the libsgd-0.18.1 version:

The "libsgd-0.18.1-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl" works with python 3.13. You need to install the lib with:
"pip install libsgd-0.18.1-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl"
To install the Demos, have a look on Point 3)
